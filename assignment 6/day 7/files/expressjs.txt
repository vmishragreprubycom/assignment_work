Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[2] It is the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.[3]

The original author, TJ Holowaychuk, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,[4] meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins. Express is the backend part of the MEAN stack, together with MongoDB database and AngularJS frontend framework.[citation needed]
